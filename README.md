# Thinking MicroCisc

Thinking MicroCISC is a series of tutorials to introduce you to programming in
uCISC. They are designed to progress carefully through all the features of uCISC
to convey both the features and general approach to programming in uCISC. Even
if you are an advanced programmer, I recommend doing the exercises in order.
You'll work through the early ones very quickly, but will get a feel for how
everything works.

## Project 1 - Calculator

The calculator series is an introduction to the very basics of uCISC. It
includes instructions on getting everything installed and how the basics work.
